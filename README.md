# RoyiFileManager

`RoyiFileManager` is a Windows only, portable fork of the [`fman`](https://github.com/mherrmann/fman) 
(By [Michael Herrmann](https://github.com/mherrmann)) dual pane file manager. 
It retains the `fman` plug-in API so existing plug-ins can be used
without changing their imports.

## Development

Install a conda package manager then create the environment:

```powershell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate RoyiFileManager
python build.py run
```

The environment intentionally constrains PyQt to the 5.15 branch. Other
packages use compatibility bounds rather than patch pins, so recreating the
environment for a release selects their latest compatible versions. `freeze`
generates the Windows release lock when it is missing or older than
`environment.yml`. It can also be generated manually:

```powershell
conda-lock lock -f environment.yml -p win-64
```

## Tests and packaging

```powershell
python build.py test
python build.py freeze
python build.py package
```

`run`, `test`, and `freeze` download the pinned x64 `7za.exe` from the official
7-Zip distribution when it is not already present under the Core plug-in.
These commands therefore require internet access on their first run.

`freeze` creates a PyInstaller onedir build. `package` produces
`target/RoyiFileManager-<version>-windows-x86_64.zip` with an empty
`UserSettings` directory. Both outputs include `environment.yml` and the
generated `conda-lock.yml`. Extract the archive to a writable directory before
running it.

All mutable application data is stored in `UserSettings` beside the
executable. Development and tests can override this path with the
`ROYIFILEMANAGER_USER_SETTINGS` environment variable.

RoyiFileManager does not intentionally write to the Windows Registry. Release
validation should confirm this with Process Monitor, filtering on the
RoyiFileManager process and Registry write operations.
